# Edges
Elements are the vertices of the graph while __edges__ associate 
the relationships identified by the user between the elements.

## Data on Edges
Not all data is stored in the Elements. The edges themselves can store data 
depending on the context. This is done to simplify the number of required nodes in the graph. The [data dictionary](./dictionary.md#edge-definitions) provides a full 
account of all edges and their associated properties.
