# Design Goals
Projects tend to take on a life of their own. To help avoid technical rabbit holes or inconsistency of implementation some guiding principles are collected here.

## The Goals
* A _small_ core system that is expandable.
* A restrained minimum viable product.
* Prefer functional solutions over object orientated. This isn't to say the project doesn't uses classes, but rather a pragmatic approach to functional composition is preferred.
* Leverage off the shelf solutions where possible (e.g. CSS frameworks).
