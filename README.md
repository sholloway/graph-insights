This code base is part of my series of experiments on building a desktop
[personal knowledge base application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base) 
that leverages an embedded graph database. 

Status: Under active development working towards version 0.1.0. Not stable. Do not use.
See the [design document](https://samuelholloway.com/graph-insights/) for details around the purpose, roadmap and design of this project.

## Repo Structure
This repository is subdivided into two build-able assets.
* _application_ - Contains the source code for the desktop PKB.
* _documentation_ - Contains a mkdoc book that describes the architecture and features.
